        aboutBMI: "Your Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It categorizes you as underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI â‰¥ 30). Underweight may indicate nutritional deficiencies; normal weight suggests a healthy weight; overweight increases risk of health issues; and obesity significantly raises risk of severe health conditions. While useful, BMI doesn't differentiate between muscle and fat, so consider it alongside other health factors like diet and activity level."
